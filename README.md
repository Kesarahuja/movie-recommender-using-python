# Movie Recommender System

Welcome to the Movie Recommender System project! This project aims to recommend movies to users based on their preferences using Python. The project is developed using PyCharm and utilizes several powerful libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.


## Features

- **Item-based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies based on similarities between items.
- **Content-based Filtering:** Recommends movies based on movie features and user preferences.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combines multiple recommendation techniques for better accuracy.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Programming language used for development.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Numpy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for building the recommender system.
